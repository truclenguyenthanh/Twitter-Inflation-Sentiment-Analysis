# Project: Twitter Inflation Sentiment Analysis

## Objective: 
In this repository, I explore the public sentiment on inflation using real-time Twitter data. By analyzing tweets, I aim to gauge the public's perception and concerns regarding economic trends.

## Dataset: 
889,928 tweets from Dec 9 - Dec 16, 2022

## Features:
 * Data Collection: Real-time streaming of tweets related to inflation using Twitter's API.
 * Natural Language Processing (NLP): Preprocessing of tweets for sentiment analysis, including tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
 * Sentiment Analysis: Classification of tweets into "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral" sentiments using machine learning techniques.
 * Visualization: Interactive dashboards showcasing sentiment trends, frequency of related topics, and geographic distribution of sentiments.

## Dependencies:
Python, Tweepy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, and AWS.
